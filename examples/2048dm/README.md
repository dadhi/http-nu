# nu2048

2048 with a per-player game library, durable state, and animated SSE
patches. Built on http-nu + cross.stream + a vendored dmax runtime.

## Run

Requires `--store` (for `.append` / `.cat`) and `--services` (for the
snapshot-actor). Add `--dev` when running over plain HTTP -- the
`session` cookie defaults to `Secure`, so the browser drops it on
`http://localhost` without `--dev`:

```bash
http-nu --dev --services --store ./store :3002 examples/2048dm/serve.nu
```

http://localhost:3002.

## How state moves

```
POST /move        ->  appends `game.<id>.move`        (intent only)
snapshot-actor    ->  reads .last snapshot, applies move, appends
                       `game.<id>.snapshot`            (canonical state)
GET  /sse/<id>    ->  follows `game.<id>.*`, gates on xs.threshold,
                       renders dmax signal and element patches
```

Move POSTs never compute state. A singleton xs actor owns writes, so two
tabs of the same game cannot race. The SSE handler is a pure reader of
the snapshot stream.

The `roll` helper hashes `(game_id, state, key)` for tile spawns; no
random seed is stored in frames. Replay reconstructs the same board.

## Layout

```
serve.nu                routes
tfe/
  game.nu               pure logic (slide, spawn, roll, apply-move)
  store.nu              .cat/.last wrappers (resume-game, list-games)
  render.nu             HTML output (board, card, layout)
  sse.nu                SSE pipeline (frames-to-states -> patches)
  snapshot-actor.nu     xs actor source (registered at startup)
  templates/            layout.html, vt-tuner.html
static/                 styles.css, script.js, og.png, ellie.png
test/                   unit tests, browser e2e, benchmark
```

`game.nu` and `store.nu` have no http-nu dependencies; they work from a
plain nu shell against a vanilla `xs serve` store.

## CLI

The running http-nu server supervises the store (its socket is at
`<store>/sock`). `.cat` / `.last` are HTTP calls over that socket --
load them via `xs.nu` (`xs nu --install`, or `use /path/to/xs.nu *`).

```nushell
$env.XS_ADDR = (realpath ./store)
overlay use -r examples/2048dm/tfe

list-players                            # players seen, with game counts
list-games | first 5                    # games by move count
leaderboard                             # top games by score, last 7 days
leaderboard --since 1day --limit 10     # window + size are tunable
resume-game "03g54..." | reject state.tiles
follow-game "03g54..." | each { reject state.tiles }

# Replay from raw move frames (no snapshots needed):
.cat -T "game.03g54.move" | project-game "03g54" | reject tiles
```

### Frame topics

| topic                       | written by      | meta                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `player.<uuid>.games`       | `GET /new`      | (none) -- frame id is the game id                                 |
| `game.<id>.move`            | `POST /move`    | `{intent, req_id, kind?}` -- `intent` in `h,j,k,l`; `kind: undo`  |
| `game.<id>.snapshot`        | snapshot-actor  | `{state, score, max_tile, moves, game_over, player_id, prev, ...}` |

`.last game.<id>.snapshot` is the canonical HEAD for a game.

## Datastar vs dmax, at the implementation level

Against the sibling `examples/2048` Datastar version, the dmax port is
already a bit smaller in the files that matter most for app wiring:

- `serve.nu`: `34033` -> `32091` bytes
- `static/script.js`: `12003` -> `7486` bytes
- `tfe/sse.nu`: `4844` -> `4820` bytes

What changed:

- dmax is more direct for this app's signal-shaped state flow:
  `data-m-si` seeds state, `data-m-get^sse` opens the stream,
  `data-m-post` sends moves, `data-m-ex` fans patches into the WC and
  chrome.
- the client script gets smaller because imperative fetch / ack / query
  glue collapsed into `dmSet(...)`, `dmSub(...)`, and `dmSel(...)`.
- the SSE pipeline itself is nearly the same size; the real difference
  is client wiring and naming consistency, not the game/store logic.

Current gaps / next improvement opportunities:

- repeated declarative move-writing shapes still want more sugar; the
  new `move-btn(...)` helper only removes server-template duplication.
- relative-time fanout (`m2048ActiveLabels`) is still a small JS helper;
  a built-in collection/map style helper could shrink this further.
- splash autoplay/seek is straightforward now, but still more explicit
  than Datastar's inline local-signal algebra; that suggests value in
  tighter dmax local-state ergonomics, not more ad-hoc app JS.
- performance work should focus on whole-page/full-morph paths; this app
  is already mostly signal + WC state writes, so its hot path is less
  about selector morphing than generic demo pages are.

## Animation

Each move runs three sequential phases on one view-transition: slide,
merge pop, spawn-in. CSS targets `view-transition-class` (set in
`render.nu` per tile: `merged`, `spawned`, `ghost`). The `[ fx ]` button
in the help panel opens a tuner for the timing knobs (durations + the
merge-pop scale + the spawn-in starting scale). Defaults live in
`static/styles.css :root`.
