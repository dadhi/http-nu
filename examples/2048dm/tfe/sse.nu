# SSE pipeline stages for the 2048 server. Composed in serve.nu as:
#
#   .cat --follow
#   | frames-to-states
#   | threshold-gate-states
#   | states-to-wc-signals
#   | html-to-patches
#   | to sse
#
# Each stage has one job. The client drives heartbeat / liveness: an
# initial ping fires from script.js once the dmax SSE stream opens
# and the existing /move + lastReqId path resolves its RTT. The server
# no longer emits keepalives, so SSE handlers wake only on real frames.

#   xs.threshold marker  -> {state, threshold: true}
#   everything else      -> dropped
# Pre-converted events pass through.
