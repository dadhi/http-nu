# nu2048 notes sub-site: digital-garden style pages, each h1 in a
# content/*.md file becomes its own page. Authors keep related topics
# in one file (easier to edit, reorder, cross-reference); the runtime
# splits on h1 boundaries so each section gets its own URL.
#
# Mount under /notes from the parent serve.nu:
#   let notes = source notes/serve.nu
#   ...
#   (mount "/notes" $notes)
#
# Pages link to each other via in-doc markdown links the author writes;
# no auto-generated next/prev. Wandering is intentional.
